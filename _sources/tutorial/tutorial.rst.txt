This is a guide to basic and some more advanced features of
the MDP library. Besides the present tutorial, you can learn
more about MDP by using the standard Python tools.
All MDP nodes have doc-strings, the public
attributes and methods have telling names: All information about a
node can be obtained using  the ``help`` and ``dir`` functions within
the Python interpreter. In addition to that, an automatically generated
`API documentation
<https://mdp-toolkit.github.io/api/index.html>`_
is available.

.. Note::
  Code snippets throughout the script will be denoted by::

      >>> print "Hello world!"
      Hello world!

  To run the following code examples don't forget to import ``mdp``
  and ``numpy`` in your Python session with::

     >>> import mdp
     >>> import numpy as np
