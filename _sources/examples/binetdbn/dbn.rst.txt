This is only a proof-of-concept, so don't expect the DBN to actually work!
Its current pupose is to experiment with different binet features.

Run this demo to view an HTML inspection of the DBN training.
This should help with understanding how the implementation works.

:ref:`dbn_nodes` â€” This is the original non-bimdp DBN node
from Pietro, which is the basis for the BiMDP DBN implementation and
is required for this example to run.

>>> import mdp
>>> import bimdp
>>> import dbn_binodes

create DBN

>>> n_layers = 2
>>> flow = dbn_binodes.get_DBN_flow(2, hidden_dims=[2,2])

create data

>>> n_samples = 10000  # number of data points
>>> n_greedy_reps = 100  # repetitions in greedy phase
>>> x = mdp.numx.zeros((n_samples, 4))
>>> for i in range(n_samples):
...     r = mdp.numx.rand()
...     if r>0.666:
...         x[i,:] = [0.,1.,0.,1.]
...     elif r>0.333:
...         x[i,:] = [1.,0.,1.,0.]

n_layers iterables plus one iterable for the DBNMasterBiNode

>>> data_iterables = [None] + [[x] * n_greedy_reps] * n_layers + [[x]]
>>> msg_iterables = ([None] +
...                  [[{"epsilon": 0.1, "decay": 0.0,
...                     "momentum": 0.0}] * n_greedy_reps] * n_layers +
...                  [[{"top_updates": 3, "epsilon": 0.1, "decay": 0.0,
...                     "momentum": 0.0,
...                     "max_iter": 2, "min_error": -1.0}]])

perform and visualize the training

>>> bimdp.show_training(flow, data_iterables, msg_iterables, debug=True)   # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
'/tmp/.../training_inspection.html'
>>> print "done."
done.
